# Fake-News-Detection
Problem 

The term fake news has become a buzz word these days.There was a time when if anyone needed any news, he or she would wait for the next-day newspaper. However, with the growth of online newspapers who update news almost instantly, people have found a better and faster way to be informed of the matter of his/her interest. Nowadays social-networking systems, online news portals, and other online media have become the main sources of news through which interesting and breaking news are shared at a rapid pace. However, many news portals serve special interest by feeding with distorted, partially correct, and sometimes imaginary news that is likely to attract the attention of a target group of people. Fake news has become a major concern for being destructive sometimes spreading confusion and deliberate disinformation among the people.

The Aim of this project is to use the Natural Language Processing and Machine learning to detect the Fake news based on the text content of the Article.

Approach 

We are using  pandas,numpy,matplotlib,seaborn libraries in python . It is a Step wise procedure from cleaning the data using nltk methods and convert the text data into vectors by TDIDF method. Modeling the cleaned and preprocessed data by applying  logistic regression algorithm and calculating the accuracy of the model by plotting confusion matrix .
